# Human Image Classification: Indian vs Non-Indian
The Human Classification project aims to classify human images as either Indian or Non-Indian. The project utilizes image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze facial features and make accurate classification predictions.

# Components
The project consists of the following components:

- Human_Classification.py: Python script containing the implementation of the human classification model.
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: XML file containing the Haar cascade for detecting frontal faces in images.
- test.py: Python script for testing the human classification model on new images.
- train.py: Python script for training the human classification model using a labeled dataset.

# Features
- Indian vs Non-Indian Classification: The model is trained to classify human images into two categories: Indian and Non-Indian.
- Facial Feature Analysis: The model analyzes facial features in the images to make accurate classification predictions.
- Machine Learning Integration: The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to train and classify the images.
- Haar Cascade Face Detection: The Haar cascade provided in the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is used for detecting frontal faces in the images.
Usage
To use the Human Classification project, follow these steps:

Training the Model:

Prepare a labeled dataset of human images, with each image labeled as Indian or Non-Indian.
Execute the train.py script to train the human classification model using the labeled dataset.
The trained model will be saved for future use.
Testing the Model:

Prepare a set of test images that you want to classify.
Execute the test.py script, providing the path to the test images and the path to the trained model.
The script will use the trained model to classify the test images and display the classification results.
Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the Human Classification project:

- Python (version 3.x)
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- Install the necessary libraries using the package manager of your choice (e.g., pip).

Future Enhancements
The current version of the Human Classification project provides a basic classification model. Here are some potential future enhancements:

Dataset Augmentation: Expand the labeled dataset by applying various data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracy and better generalization.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
Web Application: Develop a web-based application where users can upload images for classification and view the results.
